# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

## Description
The Rock-Paper-Scissors Game is a simple Python game where the player competes against the computer by choosing one of the three options: rock, paper, or scissors. The computer randomly selects its play, and the game determines the winner based on the game's rules. The player can choose to continue playing or exit the game.

## Features
- Allows players to choose rock, paper, or scissors.
- Randomly generates the computer's play.
- Determines the winner based on the game's rules.
- Provides an option for players to continue playing or exit the game.

## Learning Objectives
- **Conditional Statements**: Utilized conditional statements (if-elif-else) to determine the outcome of the game based on the user's and computer's choices.
- **Loops**: Employed a while loop to continuously prompt the user for input and play the game until the user decides to exit.
- **User Input Handling**: Utilized the `input()` function to receive user input and implemented input validation to ensure the user's input is one of the valid options (rock, paper, or scissors).
- **Random Number Generation**: Utilized the `random.choice()` function from the `random` module to generate a random choice for the computer's play.
- **Error Handling**: Implemented input validation to handle scenarios where the user enters invalid input.
- **String Manipulation**: Used string methods like `lower()` to convert user input to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.
- **Time Handling**: Utilized the `time.sleep()` function to introduce delays in the game's output, providing a more interactive experience.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Usage
1. Run the script `rock_paper_scissors.py`.
2. Enter your play: 'r' for rock, 'p' for paper, or 's' for scissors.
3. The computer will randomly select its play.
4. The game will determine the winner based on the rules of rock-paper-scissors.
5. You can choose to continue playing or exit the game.

## Example
- Start game :)
- Please enter your play (r: for rock, s: for scissors, p: for paper): r
- Your play: r
- PC play: s
- You Won :)
- Enter [ e ] To Exit or [ r ] T Replay: r
- New game

# Tic Tac Toe Game

## Description
The Tic Tac Toe Game is a simple implementation of the classic game built using the Tkinter library in Python. It allows users to play against the computer in a graphical user interface.

## Features
- Play Tic Tac Toe against the computer.
- Track the score of the player and the computer.
- Restart the game at any time.
- Displays the game result (win, lose, or tie).

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter library (usually comes pre-installed with Python)

## How to Play
1. Run the script `tic_tac_toe.py`.
2. The game window opens, displaying the Tic Tac Toe grid.
3. Click on any of the empty squares to place your mark (X).
4. The computer automatically makes its move (O) after you make yours.
5. The game result (win, lose, or tie) is displayed at the bottom of the window.
6. Click the "Restart" button to start a new game.

## Implementation Details
- The game is implemented using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface.
- The computer's moves are randomly selected from the available empty squares.
- The game tracks the score of the player and the computer.
- It checks for winning combinations after each move to determine the game result.
- The interface provides clear feedback to the player about the game outcome.

## What I've Learned
- Building a graphical user interface using Tkinter.
- Managing game logic and state in a Python script.
- Implementing game-winning logic and tie conditions.
- Handling user input and button clicks in the GUI.
- Updating the game interface dynamically based on game state changes.

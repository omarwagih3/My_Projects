- View all existing tasks.
- Delete tasks from the task list.
- Exit the program.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## How to Use
1. Run the script `task_tracker.py`.

6. Exit the program when done.

## Implementation Details
- The program is implemented in Python using basic console I/O.
- It maintains a list of tasks entered by the user.
- Users can add, view, and delete tasks using simple commands.
- Error handling is implemented to handle invalid inputs and edge cases.

## What I've Learned
- Handling user input and commands in a console-based application.
- Managing and manipulating lists in Python.
- Implementing basic control flow and error handling.
- Building a simple interactive program to manage tasks.
